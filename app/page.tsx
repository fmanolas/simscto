                  Sims is a community take-over (CTO) project that was taken
                  over after it launched on the Solana blockchain through
                  pump.fun and the developer of it had sold his position. It
                  bonded on to radium through a Mev bot which then crashed the
                  chart soon after it bonded.
                </p>
                <p className={`${poppins.className} leading-relaxed`}>
                  Since then, the community has rallied together to rebuild.
                  Every day growing and learning more about what fits where, and
                  who‚Äôs good at what. We have finally found a purpose here at
                  SIMS CTO and I believe that purpose is to DREAM.
                </p>
                <p className={`${poppins.className} leading-relaxed`}>
                  When you buy into this project, look at it like a blank
                  canvas. You have the possibility to imagine and create
                  whatever you can dream. We strive to support a healthy
                  community here, and everyone‚Äôs opinions matter. Be a part of
                  something that the blockchain has never seen before and come
                  create history in the making.
